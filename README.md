## About the App

Grateful reminder is a website dedicated to helping users remember the goodness that is in their life. The goal is to help people self-reflect and focus on the positives, regardless of how large or small. When the user logs their daily happiness score, even if the score is small, they will be shifted to focus on the three things in their day they are grateful for. The site has simple CRUD functionality to allow each user to customize their experience.

## Challenges
### Time commitment 
I began the project on without a good grasp of exactly what I wanted to do. I ran with an idea for about 3 days, only to realize the night before the assignment was due that I overreached in the time frame I was given. I ended up restarting my project to simplify and narrow the idea into a tangible application. 

### Adding in a chart
I tried to add in a chart to document the users happiness score but did not have the time to fully understand how to utilize chart.js with a one-to-one relationship application. 

## Future Goals:

* Add user-authentication so multiple users can utilize the platform and be able to make their information private

* Add some type of chart to document and trend the users happiness score

* Enhance CSS Design (mainly flex-box direction, legibility/font-coloring)
